<div class="para">In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. It is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. (…) The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians. Much early work in algebra, as the Arabic origin of its name suggests, was done in the Near East, by such mathematicians as al-Khwārizmı̄ (780 – 850) and Omar Khayyam (1048–1131)</div>
