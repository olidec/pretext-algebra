<div class="para">The most fundamental building blocks in mathematics are numbers and the operations that can be performed on them. Algebra, like arithmetic, involves performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. In arithmetic, we are performing operations on known, specific, numbers (e.g. <span class="process-math">\(5 + 3 = 8\)</span>). However, in algebra we often deal with operations on unknown numbers represented by variables usually symbolized by a letter (e .g. <span class="process-math">\(\frac{a+b}{c}=\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}\)</span>). The use of variables gives us the power to write general statements indicating relationships between numbers.</div>
